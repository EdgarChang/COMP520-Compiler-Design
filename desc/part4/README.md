# Part IV : Register Allocation


The goal of part IV is to replace the naive register allocator by a "proper" register allocator. 
As seen in the lecture, you have to implement liveness analysis on a control-flow graph and Chaitin's graph colouring algorithm.


**Important**: the marking will be done using a series of automated tests as in part III.
Your mark will be a function of the number of tests your compiler compiles correctly.
However, we will also do a manual inspection of your code to verify that you are using liveness analysis and Chaitin algorithm for register allocation.
If you do not implement the algorithm below and instead simply use the naive register allocator as for part III, you will score 0 for this part.

## 1. Building Control-Flow Graph (CFG)

Your first task should consist of taking the assembly program produced by your code generator (with virtual registers) and transform it to a control flow graph.
Although a production compiler would likely use the concept of basic blocks, we suggest that you keep a simple approach where each node of the CFG contains a single instruction.

For this task, you should write your own directed graph data structure in Java (reminder: are not allowed to use a library and all the code should be written by you and you alone (do not copy/paste from the web!)).
In order to verify that you have built the CFG correctly, you may want to write a Dot printer to visualize the CFG.

## 2. Liveness Analysis

Once you have correctly built the CFG, your next task should be to implement liveness analysis.
As seen during the lectures, you should implement this as a simple fixed-point algorithm.
For this project, it is okay to process the nodes in any order (no need to sort them).
However, if you want to ensure a faster convergence time, you should compute the LiveOut set before the LiveIn set as seen in the lecture.

The output of the liveness analysis should be a liveIn and liveOut set for each node in the CFG.

## 3. Interference Graph

Once you have performed liveness analysis, you next step should consist of building the interference graph as seen in the lecture.
The interference graph is an undirected graph and you should implement your own Java data structure to represent it.
A node of the interference graph represents a single virtual register.
Two nodes are connected if there exist a liveIn or LiveOut set where both corresponding virtual registers are present (there is a point in the program execution where both virtual registers are alive at the same time).


## 4. Graph colouring with Chaitin algorithm

Your next job should be to implement Chaitin algorithm for graph colouring as shown in the lecture.
For this task, your register allocator should only use the following set of MIPS registers when mapping virtual registers: `$t0-9` and `$s0-s7`.
Your allocator should not make any distinctions between the `$s` and `$t` registers (we are deviating from the MIPS convention here and treat all these registers in the same way).
Note that your code generator is of course free to use the other classical MIPS registers such as `$fp` or `$sp`, but the virtual registers should only be mapped to the registers specified above.

**Hint**: Contrary to what the lecture slides might suggest, you may not want to actually remove nodes from the graph when adding them to the stack as this would complicate your job.
Instead, we suggest that you simply add them to the stack and when you request the list of neighbours from a node, you can simply discard the nodes from that list that appear on the stack.
 

### Spilling

Your allocator should support the ability to spill registers when it is not possible to find a node in the graph with less than k neighbours.
As seen in the lectures, there are two approaches you can take.
We suggest that you implement the simple approach which simply reserves a fixed set of registers to be used for spilling.
You should never need more than three registers for this job since this is the maximum number of operands a MIPS instruction can have.
When you need to spill a node, simply remove it from the graph and add it to a set of nodes to be spilled.

## 5. Output produced

Your implementation of the algorithm should produce two results: a set of virtual registers to be spilled (may be empty) and a mapping of virtual registers to architecture registers (`$t0-9`, `$s0-s7`).
Using these two outputs, you should then go back to the list of instructions and patch it up to replace each virtual registers with either an architectural register, or with a load/store instruction if the virtual register is spilled.
You should also at this point expand the two pseudo-instructions `pushRegisters` and `popRegisters`.

You will find it useful to reuse the existing logic from the `NaiveRegAlloc` when performing this step.
Note that line 41 of the corresponding file contains the registers that are used to load/store the spilled virtual registers (the naive register allocator spills everything).
As mentioned, you should never need more than three registers when spilling.
Therefore, when reusing this code, you should really only be using three registers and not six as the original code suggest.
